# Count-Smaller-Elements-on-right-side
Write a program to count number of smaller elements on right of each element in an array. Given an unsorted array arr[] of distinct integers, construct another array countSmaller[] such that countSmaller[i] contains count of smaller elements on right side of each element arr[i] in array.
# Example:
Input:   arr[] =  {12, 1, 2, 3, 0, 11, 4}
Output:  countSmaller[]  =  {6, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0}
